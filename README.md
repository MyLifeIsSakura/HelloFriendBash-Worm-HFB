# HelloFriendBash
Dangerous worm that infects computers in you network. Part 1: https://github.com/MyLifeIsSakura/HelloFriendWorm-HFW-2.0
This is part 2 of HelloFriend Worm/HFW, HFW part one was in vbs and was a dangerous email worm that spread via autlook by sending itself to contacts,
but people learn, they dont open random files in suspicius emails anymore, so this is the new HelloFriend, a new generation! it doesnt use email anymore it
uses network connections! i'll explain.

What de Worm doing?:

 HelloFriendBash, HFB or hello_friend.txt.bat is part 2 of hello_friend.txt.vbs and doesnt use email, picture this, you're playing... i dont know fornite i guess?
 and suddenly you see your pc is slowing down, you open task manager- BUT YOU CANT, task manager has been terminated, and then you here a suprised gasp from your
 moms room, her computer is also now infected, no emails, no confirmation, it just spreads by wifi! if you brought a laptop with this worm into a cafe with a free wifi
 then everyone in the cafe is fucked:)
 
Extras:
 
 this isnt just a changed "https://github.com/MyLifeIsSakura/HelloFriendWorm-HFW-2.0", its better IN ALL WAYS!
 HFW adds 1 autorun to the registry, but HFB adds ABOUT 20! and also adds itself to as much autoruners it can find, it doesnt just avoid detection
 by bieng confusing, it disables you mouse and keyboard! also moves your mouse for you (i stole that from MEMZ and intensified it)
 it also adds copies of itself to the root c:/ directory!
 
Means of spreading:

 Spreads automatically to network connected devices.
 
 Sends out emails.
 
 Piggybacks on legitimatily mailed attachments (still experiment idk if it works)
